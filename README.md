# Figma Component Text to Spreadsheet 
This is a Figma plugin is a small utility that takes the text elements from instances of a component and outputs them in a csv or json format. More details and documentation to come.

## Usage Scenario
Let's say you're working on a design project that just moved into the ideation phase. You and your teammates generate some ideas, and put them into virtual sticky notes on Figma. Maybe you drag them around, generate more ideas, and do some affinity mapping.

Now, you want to more methodically sort and filter these ideas, and perhaps put them in a weighted matrix later. How do you bring all the sticky notes into a spreadsheet? This plugin invites you to select a component (in this scenario, the sticky note component), after which it'll grab all the text from the component instances and put them in a CSV format, which you can then open as a shiny spreadsheet.
